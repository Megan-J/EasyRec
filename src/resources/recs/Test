Letter of Recommendation

For: asdf Test

Date: 2023-05-25

To: Graduate Admissions Committee 

I am writing this letter to recommend my former student asdf Test who is applying for the Doctor of Philosophy in your school. 

I met asdf in Fall of 1234 when he enrolled in my "CS256: Cryptography".

asdf earned "A" from this tough course, and this shows how knowledgeable and hard worker he is. 

He also earned a "B" from my "CS160: Software Engineering", and a "C" from my " CS256: Cryptography".

asdf worked hard, and was very well prepared for every exam and assignment. 

He was always very passionate, and very enthusiastic. 

Furthermore, I noticed from the term project result, he developed leadership, time management, and problem-solving skills.
He worked effectively with the team members and delegated tasks appropriately. He was able to deliver a successful project in a timely fashion.

I believe that asdf has the capacity to excel at higher education program and this is my pleasure to highly recommend him. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me with further questions.


Very Respectfully,
