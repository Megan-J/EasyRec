Letter of Recommendation

For: Tyler 1016

Date: 2023-06-10

To: Graduate Admissions Committee 

I am writing this letter to recommend my former student Tyler 1016 who is applying for the Master of Science in your school. 

I first met Tyler in Spring of 123 when he earned a A from my CS146: Data Structures and Algorithms, and a B from my  CS152: Programming Language Paradigm.

Tyler submitted well-written assignments, and participated in all of my class activities. 

He was always very enthusiastic, and punctual. 

Furthermore, I noticed from the term project result, he developed leadership, time management, and problem-solving skills.
He worked effectively with the team members and delegated tasks appropriately. He was able to deliver a successful project in a timely fashion.
I believe that Tyler has the capacity to excel at higher education program and this is my pleasure to highly recommend him. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me with further questions.


Very Respectfully,
