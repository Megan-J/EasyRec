For: Tyler 1002

Date: 2023-06-08

To: Graduate Admissions Committee 

I am writing this letter to recommend my former student Tyler 1002 who is applying for the Master of Science in your school. 

I first met Tyler in Fall of 1 when he earned a A from my CS160: Software Engineering, a B from my  CS256: Cryptography, and a C from my  CS146: Data Structures and Algorithms.

Tyler worked hard, was very well prepared for every exam and assignment, and picked up new skills very quickly. 

He was always very passionate, very enthusiastic, and very enthusiastic. 

Furthermore, I noticed from the term project result, he developed leadership, time management, and problem-solving skills.
He worked effectively with the team members and delegated tasks appropriately. He was able to deliver a successful project in a timely fashion.
I believe that Tyler has the capacity to excel at higher education program and this is my pleasure to highly recommend him. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me with further questions.


Very Respectfully,
