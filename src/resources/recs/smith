Letter of Recommendation

For: Adam Smith

Date: 2023-02-20

To: Graduate Admissions Committee 

I am writing this letter to recommend my former student Adam Smith who is applying for the Master of Science in your school. 

I met Adam in Fall of 2022 when he enrolled in my "CS154: Theory of Computation".

Adam earned "A+" from this tough course, and this shows how knowledgeable and hard worker he is. 

He also earned and a "A" from my "CS151: Object-Oriented Design".

Adam worked hard, was very well prepared for every exam and assignment, picked up new skills very quickly, and was able to excel academically at the top of my class. 

He was always very passionate, punctual, attentive, and polite. 

Furthermore, I noticed from the term project result, he developed leadership, time management, and problem-solving skills.
He worked effectively with the team members and delegated tasks appropriately. He was able to deliver a successful project in a timely fashion.

I believe that Adam has the capacity to excel at higher education program and this is my pleasure to highly recommend him. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me with further questions.


Very Respectfully,

Ahmad Yazdankhah
