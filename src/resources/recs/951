I am writing this letter to recommend my former student first 951 who is applying for the Master of Science in your school. I met first in Fall of 132 when He earned a 1 from my CS146: Data Structures and Algorithms, and a 2 from my  CS152: Programming Language Paradigm.

first submitted well-written assignments, participated in all of my class activities, worked hard. 

He was always very passionate, very enthusiastic, punctual. 

Furthermore, I noticed from the term project result, he developed leadership, time management, and problem-solving skills.
He worked effectively with the team members and delegated tasks appropriately. He was able to deliver a successful project in a timely fashion.
I believe that first has the capacity to excel at higher education program and this is my pleasure to highly recommend him. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me with further questions.
