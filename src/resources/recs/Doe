Letter of Recommendation

For: John

Date: 2023-04-26

To: Graduate Admissions Committee 

I am writing this letter to recommend my former student John Doe who is applying for the MS in your school. 

I met John in Spring of 2021 when he enrolled in my CS151: Object-Oriented Design, CS166: Information Security, CS154: Theory of Computation,  course.

John earned an A from this tough course, and this shows how knowledgeable and hard working he is.

He also earned  from my course.

JohnPlease do not hesitate to contact me with further questions.



Very Respectfully,
