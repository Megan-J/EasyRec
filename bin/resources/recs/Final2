To: Graduate Admissions Committee 

I am writing this letter to recommend my former student Final2 Final2 who is applying for the Doctor of Philosophy in your school. 

I met Final2 in Fall of 123 when she enrolled in my CS256: Cryptography, CS146: Data Structures and Algorithms, CS152: Programming Language Paradigm, courses.

Final2 earned an A from this tough course, and this shows how knowledgeable and hard working she is.

She also earned a B from my CS256: Cryptography, a A from my  CS146: Data Structures and Algorithms, and a A from my  CS152: Programming Language Paradigm.

Final2 participated in all of my class activities, worked hard. 

She was always very passionate. 

Furthermore, I noticed from the term project result, she developed leadership, time management, and problem-solving skills.
She worked effectively with the team members and delegated tasks appropriately. She was able to deliver a successful project in a timely fashion.
I believe that Final2 has the capacity to excel at higher education program and this is my pleasure to highly recommend him. 
Please do not hesitate to contact me with further questions.



Very Respectfully,
