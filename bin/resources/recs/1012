I am writing this letter to recommend my former student Tyler 1012 who is applying for the Master of Business Administration in your school. 

I first met Tyler in Fall of 123 when she earned a Afrom my CS146: Data Structures and Algorithms, and a B from my  CS152: Programming Language Paradigm.

Tyler  andparticipated in all of my class activities. 

She was always  and very enthusiastic. 

Furthermore, I noticed from the term project result, she developed leadership, time management, and problem-solving skills.
She worked effectively with the team members and delegated tasks appropriately. She was able to deliver a successful project in a timely fashion.
I believe that Tyler has the capacity to excel at higher education program and this is my pleasure to highly recommend him. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me with further questions.


Very Respectfully,
